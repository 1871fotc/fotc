# Paddington Cemetery 

The North Brisbane Burial Grounds were also known as 'Paddington Cemetery' or 'Milton Cemetery'. The burial grounds opened in 1844 and closed in 1875. The burial grounds had seven distinct denominational sections: Episcopalian (Anglican), Presbyterian, Roman Catholic, Jewish, Wesleyan Methodist, Congregational, and Baptist.

By 1907 there were calls to turn the neglected burial grounds into a park and sports field. In 1911 the Queensland Government passed the *[Paddington Cemetery Act][Paddington Cemetery Act]* allowing them to move the bodies to another location. Most were moved to Toowong Cemetery:

- 139 human remains and 105 memorials were moved to Toowong Cemetery.
- 505 memorials were moved to a reserved area at Paddington. These disappeared in the 1930's.
- ?? memorials have been discovered in [Archaeological digs at Toowong Cemetery](../headstones/archaeological-digs.md). ?? of these match memorials from the North Brisbane Burial Grounds.

## Richard Belford <small>(15‑11‑6)</small>

For many years Richard was connected with the colonial press in NSW, Victoria and Queensland. He was a native of Newtown, Limavady, in the county of Londonderry, Northern Ireland and came to NSW in 1838 with his parents, Richard (Snr) and Ann (née Linton). 

He was a partner in starting the *Ballarat Star* but after the partnership collapsed, moved to Brisbane and then to Ipswich where he took charge of the *North Australian* newspaper. Richard followed when that newspaper moved to Brisbane and died at the age of 42 from consumption on 28 April 1865. He was originally interred in the Roman Catholic burial ground at Milton but his remains and headstone were relocated to Toowong Cemetery in 1913.
