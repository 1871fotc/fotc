#  Data

We share our data to help others discover and share the history and stories of Toowong Cemetery.

Where practical, we link to authoritative data sources rather than duplicate data. Our unique data are: 

- Biographies
- Images of headstones

We try follow standard definitions and formats where available to help you connect with other data. For example: 

- [Graves Ontology Specification - 1.0](https://rdf.muninn-project.org/ontologies/graves.html)

We share data in multiple ways to maximise and simplify reuse. For example:

- as Common Separated Value (CSV) file 
- as linked data (JSON-LD)
