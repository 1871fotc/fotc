# About Friends of Toowong Cemetery  

**Friends of Toowong Cemetery is a volunteer group that discover and share the history and stories of Toowong Cemetery.**

<!-- photo of members -->

## What we do 

The Friends of Toowong Cemetery:

- **research the history of Toowong Cemetery**, its headstone designs, and the biographies of the people interred there. We encourage others to do to the same.
- **share our discoveries** with the community through our publications, guided heritage tours, self-guided walks, our educational museum, and contributions to other local history resources.
- **contribute stories** of individuals interred at the Toowong and [Milton/Paddington cemeteries](https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/community-and-safety/community-support/cemeteries/historic-cemeteries/paddington-cemetery) to publications and biographical databases.
- **participate in archaeological digs** in the cemetery grounds in conjunction with the [University of Queensland Archaeology Department](https://social-science.uq.edu.au/undergraduate/archaeology). The dig searches for [buried headstones](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-05-26/archaeology-dig-at-toowong-cemetery-a-chance-to-unearth-history/9800474) from previously demolished graves and is [open to the public](https://archaeologyweek.org/events-list/national-archaeology-week-2022).
- **consult with the Brisbane City Council** on future plans, new initiatives, and the restoration of graves.
- **locate marked and unmarked graves**. Contact us to ask us to:
    - mark the side of the road with the section number relating to your search to help you to find it easily when you visit.
    - outline an unmarked grave using a surface spray if the grave is unmarked. The spray does no harm and two mowings later will have disappeared. 
    - take digital photographs of a grave and email it to you.

## What we've done

## What we're working on

Currently we are: 

- updating our website (if you're reading this, you're looking at our work in progress)
- creating a simple logo <br><br> ![](../assets/fotc@0.5x.png){ width="32px" } <br>
- updating the directions and maps for our [self‑guided walks](../walks/index.md). To update the maps we need access to the location data for the cemetery and someone skilled in making maps. Can you help?  
- encouraging the community to volunteer through a simple one-off interaction. On this site you'll find these opportunities shown in orange Volunteer boxes like the one below.
