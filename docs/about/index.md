# About Us 

![](../assets/fotc-banner-1280x320.png)

**Friends of Toowong Cemetery is a volunteer group that discover and share the history and stories of Toowong Cemetery.**

## What we do 

The Friends of Toowong Cemetery:

- **research the history of Toowong Cemetery**, its [headstones](../headstones/), and the [biographies](../bios/) of the people interred there. 
- **share our discoveries** with the community through our publications, [guided tours](../guided-tours.md), [self‑guided walks](../walks/index.md), our [museum](../cemetery/museum.md).
- **contribute stories** of people interred at the Toowong and [Paddington cemeteries](https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/community-and-safety/community-support/cemeteries/historic-cemeteries/paddington-cemetery) to other publications and biographical databases.
- **clean and conserve headstones**.
- **search for buried headstones** in [archaeological digs](../headstones/archaeological-digs.md) in the cemetery grounds. 
- **consult with the Brisbane City Council** on future plans and the restoration of graves.
- **locate marked and unmarked graves**.

## What we've done

The Friends of Toowong Cemetery have:

- **established the [Federation Pavilion](federation-pavilion.md)**, which commemorates the contribution of the delegates who attended the 1891 Australian Federation Convention that are buried at the Toowong Cemetery. 
- **commemorated the [140th Anniversary of the cemetery](140-commemoration.md)**. We received an Award from the  National Trust of Queensland for our work.
- provided **biographies for information signs** at significant grave sites.
- **renamed cemetery roads** after notable people buried nearby to make it easier to find your way around the cemetery.
- shared the history and stories of Toowong Cemetery through monthly **[guided tours](../guided-tours.md)**.
- **[published books, a DVD](publications.md)** and **[self‑guided walks](../walks/index.md)**

## What we're working on

Currently we are: 

- planning to erect an **[honour board](https://youtu.be/mVfixEzUpwk)** at the cemetery's main entrance to commemorate people who have served their nation in military uniform and now rest in Toowong Cemetery.
- **photographing every headstone** in the cemetery.
- **updating our website** to include [even more content](https://github.com/Stephen-Gates/fotc/projects/1?fullscreen=true), including updating the directions and maps for our [self‑guided walks](../walks/index.md). 
- **encouraging the community to volunteer** through simple one-off tasks shown on this site like the one below. 

!!! question "Volunteer opportunity"

    To update our maps we need:
    
    - access and a licence to the location data for the cemetery (boundaries, internal and surrounding roads, portions, sections and graves, building outlines, monuments, waterways, taps). Ideally this would be released as Open Data.
    - access and a licence to the [grave data](https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/community-and-safety/community-support/cemeteries/grave-location-search). Ideally this would be released as Open Data.
    - someone skilled in making maps. **Can you help?** 


## What have we got planned? 

With the **150th Anniversary** of the opening of Toowong Cemetery on **Saturday 5 July 2025** we're planning a very special event. More will be revealed closer to the day.
