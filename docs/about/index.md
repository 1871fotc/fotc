<!-- photo of members -->

## What we do 

The Friends of Toowong Cemetery:

- **research the history of Toowong Cemetery**, its [headstone designs](../headstones/symbolism.md), and the [biographies](../bios/bio-index.md) of the people interred there. 
- **share our discoveries** with the community through our publications, [guided heritage tours](../guided-tours.md), [self-guided walks](../walks/index.md), our [educational museum](../cemetery/museum.md), and contributions to other local history resources.
- **contribute stories** of individuals interred at the Toowong and [Paddington cemeteries](https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/community-and-safety/community-support/cemeteries/historic-cemeteries/paddington-cemetery) to publications and biographical databases.
- **clean and conserve headstones**.
- **search for buried headstones** in [archaeological digs](archaeological-digs.md) in the cemetery grounds. 
- **consult with the Brisbane City Council** on future plans, new initiatives, and the restoration of graves.
- **locate marked and unmarked graves**.

## What we've done

The Friends of Toowong Cemetery have:

- **established [Federation Pavilion](federation-pavilion.md)**, which commemorates the contribution of the delegates who attended the 1891 Federation that are buried at the Toowong Cemetery. It was officially opened on 3 March 2001.

- provided **biographies for information signs** at significant grave sites.
- **renamed cemetery roads** after notable people buried nearby to make it easier to find your way around the cemetery.
- provided **[guided heritage tours](../guided-tours.md)** since 1996.
- published: 
    - **[Self‑guided walks](../walks/index.md)** 
    - **Toowong Cemetery resource manual : a guide for exploring the cemetery**, which is recommended for teachers of school groups visiting the cemetery. It is available at [Brisbane City Council Libraries](https://library-brisbane.ent.sirsidynix.net.au/client/en_AU/eLibCat/search/detailnonmodal/ent:$002f$002fSD_ILS$002f0$002fSD_ILS:71596/one), or for [purchase](mailto://inquiries@fotc.org.au) for $25.

## What we're working on

Currently we are: 

- creating a database of people who have served their nation in military uniform and now rest in Toowong Cemetery. These men and women will be recognised on an [honour board](https://youtu.be/mVfixEzUpwk) at the cemetery's main entrance.
- updating our website to include [even more content](https://github.com/Stephen-Gates/fotc/projects/1?fullscreen=true).
- updating the directions and maps for our [self‑guided walks](../walks/index.md). 
- encouraging the broader community to volunteer through a simple one-off interaction. On this site you'll find these opportunities shown in green Volunteer Opportunity boxes like the one below. 

!!! question "Volunteer opportunity"

    To update our maps we need:
    
    - access and a licence to the location data for the cemetery (boundaries, internal and surrounding roads, portions, sections and graves, building outlines, monuments, waterways, taps). Ideally this would be released as Open Data.
    - access and a licence to the [grave data](https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/community-and-safety/community-support/cemeteries/grave-location-search). Ideally this would be released as Open Data.
    - someone skilled in making maps. **Can you help?** 


## What have we got planned? 

With the **150th Anniversary** of the opening of Toowong Cemetery on **Saturday 5 July 2025** we're planning a very special event. More will be revealed closer to the day.
