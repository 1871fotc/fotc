## What we do 

The Friends of Toowong Cemetery:

- research the history of Toowong Cemetery, its monument designs, and the biographies of the people interred there.
- collate research on individuals buried at the Toowong and [Milton/Paddington cemeteries](https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/community-and-safety/community-support/cemeteries/historic-cemeteries/paddington-cemetery) into a biographical database.
- promote and encourage further research on these people, and their headstones and monuments.
- provide [free guided tours](/walks) of the cemetery to educate and disseminate culture to the community. 
- operate an educational museum on the Toowong Cemetery site. 
- participate in a [yearly archaeological dig](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-05-26/archaeology-dig-at-toowong-cemetery-a-chance-to-unearth-history/9800474) in the cemetery grounds in conjunction with the [University of Queensland Archaeology Department](https://social-science.uq.edu.au/undergraduate/archaeology). The dig searches for buried headstones from previously demolished graves, and is [open to the public](https://archaeologyweek.org/events-list/national-archaeology-week-2022).
- consult with the [Brisbane City Council](https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/community-and-safety/community-support/cemeteries/toowong-cemetery) in decisions regarding future plans, new initiatives, and restoration of graves.

## What we have done

The Friends of Toowong Cemetery have:

- researched and published a [Resource Manual: a guide to visiting Toowong Cemetery](), which is recommended for teachers of school groups visiting the cemetery. It is available at [Brisbane City Council Libraries](https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/things-to-see-and-do/council-venues-and-precincts/libraries), the [Paddington Ward Office](https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/about-council/governance-and-strategy/lord-mayor-and-councillors/ward-office-locations/paddington-ward), or for [purchase](mailto://inquiries@fotc.org.au) for $25. Invoices can be made to your school.
<!-- Why not publish the resource for free? -->
- arranged the celebration of the [140th Anniversary Commemoration of the cemetery](140-commemoration.md) and received a Silver Award in the 2012 National Trust of Queensland Heritage Awards for Volunteer Projects.
- published [Extraordinary Stories of Ordinary People](), a compilation of stories, submitted by the public, about people buried at Toowong Cemetery. 
- established the The Federation Pavilion, which commemorates the contribution of the delegates who attended the 1891 Federation that are buried at the Toowong Cemetery. It was officially opened on the 3rd of March 2001.
