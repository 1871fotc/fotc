## What we're working on

Currently we are: 

- planning to erect an **[honour board](https://youtu.be/mVfixEzUpwk)** at the cemetery's main entrance to commemorate people who have served their nation in military uniform and now rest in Toowong Cemetery.
- **photographing every headstone** in the cemetery.
- **updating our website** <!-- to include [even more content](https://github.com/1871fotc/fotc/projects/1?fullscreen=true), including updating the directions and maps for our [self‑guided walks](../walks/index.md). -->
- **encouraging the community to volunteer** through simple one-off tasks shown on this site like the one below. 

!!! question "Volunteer - help us update the cemetery maps"

    To update our maps we need:
    
    - access and a licence to the cemetery location data and [grave data](https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/community-and-safety/community-support/cemeteries/grave-location-search). 
    - someone skilled in making maps. **Can you help?** 

<!--
## What have we got planned? 

With the **150th Anniversary** of the opening of Toowong Cemetery on **Saturday 5 July 2025** we're planning a very special event. More will be revealed closer to the day.
