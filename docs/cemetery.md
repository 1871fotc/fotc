## Getting here

If you're driving to the cemetery, it has two entrances:

- The main entrance, on the **[corner on Frederick Street and Mt Coot-tha Road, Toowong](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Toowong+Cemetery/@-27.4772749,152.9818283,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x6b9150c2f0f2e23f:0xf02a35bd720a310!8m2!3d-27.4772714!4d152.9839608)** can only be entered via a slip road approaching from the west.
- The back gate entrance, **opposite [26 Richer St, Toowong](https://www.google.com/maps/place/25+Richer+St,+Toowong+QLD+4066/@-27.4737507,152.9767263,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x6b9150dd31b12cc5:0xc3a1deb2fe09484!8m2!3d-27.4737555!4d152.978915)** is much easier to access.

## Museum

<!-- photographs -->

An Educational Museum is operated by the Friends of Toowong Cemetery. 

The Museum is opened before and after our [guided heritage tours](guided-tours.md). If you would like to visit the museum but it is closed, staff at the Office will be pleased to open it for you.

### The Museum's History

The Museum building, located over the open drain, was formerly the Sexton's office and was built at the turn of the century. It is a single storey, single skin timber framed building with terracotta tile roof. The two room structure is located above the floor of an earlier structure identified as the flower shed which was associated with the cultivation and selling of flowers from Portion 10. The internal partition wall was reconstructed, windows replaced and an adjoining store room was demolished as part of the museum conversion project carried out by the Brisbane City Council Heritage Unit in 1991.
