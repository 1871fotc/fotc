*<small>Toowong Cemetery Main Entrance off Frederick Street</small>*

## Getting here

### Driving

If you're driving to the cemetery, it has two entrances:

- The main entrance (above), at **[Frederick Street, Toowong](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Toowong+Cemetery/@-27.4772749,152.9818283,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x6b9150c2f0f2e23f:0xf02a35bd720a310!8m2!3d-27.4772714!4d152.9839608)**,  can only be entered via a slip road beside the roundabout, approaching from the west.
- The back entrance, **[opposite 26 Richer Street, Toowong](https://www.google.com/maps/place/25+Richer+St,+Toowong+QLD+4066/@-27.4737507,152.9767263,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x6b9150dd31b12cc5:0xc3a1deb2fe09484!8m2!3d-27.4737555!4d152.978915)** is much easier to access. 

Parking is available inside the cemetery along the roads. Please park on the left side of two‑way roads where possible.

### Walking

If you're walking, in addition to the entries above, you can enter via:

- the pedestrian ramp from Mt Coot-tha Road, opposite the **[Mt Coot-tha Botanic Gardens](https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/things-to-see-and-do/council-venues-and-precincts/parks/botanic-gardens-in-brisbane/brisbane-botanic-gardens-mt-coot-tha)**. Turn right at the top of the ramp and walk downhill to go to Canon Garland Place.
- Frederick Street gate (opposite Sleath Street) that leads onto Steel Rudd Avenue (previously 4th Avenue).
- the many informal entries off Birdwood Terrace.

### Public Transport

If you're using public transport to get here, use the **[TransLink Journey Planner](https://jp.translink.com.au/plan-your-journey/journey-planner)** to plan your trip. Be aware some results tell you to walk across the road at the Toowong roundabout - this is not safe and you may need to walk a long way to find a safe place to cross Milton Road or the Western Freeway. Options are: 

- cross Milton Road at its intersection with Morley Street
- cross the Western Freeway using the [Canon Garland Overpass](https://garlandmemorial.com/2019/10/09/canon-garland-overpass/), a bike and walking bridge accessed from Anzac Park
- choose a bus the avoids the need to cross (e.g. Routes [471](https://jp.translink.com.au/plan-your-journey/timetables/bus/t/471/outbound/), [598](https://jp.translink.com.au/plan-your-journey/timetables/bus/t/598), [599](https://jp.translink.com.au/plan-your-journey/timetables/bus/t/599))

## When you arrive

If you enter main entrance through the front gates, you'll find: 

- Canon Garland Place named after **[Canon David John Garland](https://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/garland-david-john-6278)**. The Flagpole here is the departure point for **[guided heritage tours](../guided-tours.md)** and most **[self-guided walks](../walks/index.md)**.
- the **[Office](https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/community-and-safety/community-support/cemeteries/toowong-cemetery)** - staff can answer your enquiries and help to locate graves and ashes memorial sites.
- a **[Museum](museum.md)** operated by the Friends of Toowong Cemetery. 
- toilets, the only ones available in the cemetery.

- veer left at the Shelter Shed down the one‑way William Brown Avenue (previously 14th Avenue)
