## Markers

Markers can be seen on, or embedded into, graves. They represent a person buried in the grave. There is no simple way to link a person's marker to the appropriate grave (portion-section-plot).

To map a marker to a grave, you need to look up old portion books. For example Portion 1, Section 1, Plot 1 maps to Marker XI 755.
