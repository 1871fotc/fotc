## Old Paddington Cemetery 

Where Lang Park, now Suncorp Stadium, stands used to be the Paddington Cemetery.
 
From Brisbane City Council's recount of the history of the cemetery:
 
Paddington Cemetery operated from 1844 to 1870 and was Brisbane Town's main cemetery. Like most Victorian cemeteries the grounds were divided into sections based on religious denominations:
 
Episcopalian (Anglican)
Wesleyan (Methodist)
Roman Catholic
Presbyterian
Baptist
Congregational
Jewish
 
There were also sections for heathens and paupers.
 
By 1910 the cemetery fell into disrepair and it was proposed the grounds be turned into a recreation reserve.
 
In 1911 Queensland Parliament passed The Paddington Cemetery Act. This authorised the government to resume the cemetery and to relocate the remains to another cemetery within 12 months.
 
The remains of 186 people were removed and reburied, mainly in Toowong Cemetery, and 136 memorials were removed and relocated.
 
A further 505 memorials and headstones were transferred to a small reserve established next to Christ Church, Milton in 1913 to 1914.
 
A register of the reburials was created and the list published in the Government Gazette in 1914. A report on the closure of the cemetery and the reburial works undertaken were also included. However, as there were no formal burial registers kept during the cemetery's operation, it is impossible to trace all the 4643 gravesites that were identified when the cemetery closed.
 
By 1914 the creation of the parkland was underway. The parkland was named Lang Park in honour of John Dunmore Lang's contribution to the Brisbane area.
