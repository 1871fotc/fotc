# Guided Tours

## Heritage Tours

The Friends of Toowong Cemetery offer guided heritage walking tours on the **[first Sunday of every month](https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/custom.html?year=2022&y2=2023&months=24&country=29&typ=3&display=3&cols=0&fdow=7&hol=0&ctf=5&ctc=2&holmark=2&hod=1&hcl=1&cdt=7&cwd=1______&holm=1&df=1)** (except January) from **10.30am to 12 noon**. 

Volunteer guides lead you on a heritage walk through the cemetery. The **[Toowong Cemetery Museum](cemetery/museum.md)** will be open before and after the walk and has an extensive display of photographs and artefacts.

There is **no need to book**, just **meet under the flagpole, in Canon Garland Place at the Toowong Cemetery**. There is plenty of parking available inside the cemetery.

## Other Tours

Other volunteer groups and commercial operators run tours in the cemetery under licence from the Council. These tours are not associated with the Friends of Toowong Cemetery.

- **[Tragic Tales of Toowong Cemetery](https://www.fosbc.com/tours/tragic-tales-toowong-tour/)** is a unique night tour that focusses on some of the ghost stories, cemetery folklore and the horrible history surrounding this priceless heritage-listed site. Hear amazing true stories of the Moreton Bay Penal Settlement, Brisbaneâ€™s lost graveyard, horrific hangings, bloody murders, and, in among this horrible history, be prepared for some spine-tingling tales of the ghosts that are said to reside within Toowong Cemetery.

- **[Toowong Cemetery Ghost Tours](https://ghosttoursaustralia.com.au/brisbane-ghost-tours/toowong-cemetery-original/)** is a commercial tour run in the cemetery at night.
