# Guided Tours

!!! warning "COVID-19 Restrictions" 

    - Due to COVID-19 our guided tours are **limited to 15 guests** to enable social distancing to be maintained. 
    - Unfortunately we don't have a booking system, so guests will be invited to join us on a "first come, first served" basis. 
    - We apologise in advance if you come to the cemetery but are unable to join the tour due to it being over-subscribed. There are many **[self-guided walks](../walks/)** you can do as an alternative.


Friends of Toowong Cemetery volunteers guide you on 10 different heritage walks each year. 

![][image11]{ width="32%" } ![][image9]{ width="32%" } ![][image8]{ width="32%" }

Every walk is different and this drives our research and the creation of more **[Biographies](bios/index.md)**.

The **[Toowong Cemetery Museum](cemetery/museum.md)** will be open before and after the walk.

There's **no need to book**, just **meet under the flagpole, in Canon Garland Place at the Toowong Cemetery**. There is plenty of parking available inside the cemetery.

**Guided  tours are free** but a small donation is appreciated to help us continue **[our work](about/index.md)**. 

Wear a hat, enclosed shoes, and bring a water bottle.

## Other Tours

Other volunteer groups and commercial operators run tours in the cemetery under licence from the Council. These tours are not associated with the Friends of Toowong Cemetery.

- **[Tragic Tales of Toowong Cemetery](https://www.fosbc.com/tours/tragic-tales-toowong-tour/)** is a unique night tour that focusses on some of the ghost stories, cemetery folklore and the horrible history surrounding this priceless heritage-listed site. Hear amazing true stories of the Moreton Bay Penal Settlement, Brisbane’s lost graveyard, horrific hangings, bloody murders, and, in among this horrible history, be prepared for some spine-tingling tales of the ghosts that are said to reside within Toowong Cemetery.

- **[Toowong Cemetery Ghost Tours](https://ghosttoursaustralia.com.au/brisbane-ghost-tours/toowong-cemetery-original/)** is a commercial tour run in the cemetery at night.
