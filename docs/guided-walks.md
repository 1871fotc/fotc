# Guided Heritage Walks

**Walking tours are currently not operating due to COVID-19.**

On the [first Sunday of every month](https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/custom.html?year=2022&y2=2023&months=24&country=29&typ=3&display=3&cols=0&fdow=7&hol=0&ctf=5&ctc=2&holmark=2&hod=1&hcl=1&cdt=7&cwd=1______&holm=1&df=1) (except January) from 10.30am to 12 noon, volunteer guides from the Friends of Toowong Cemetery lead a guided heritage walk through the cemetery. The Toowong Cemetery Museum will be open before and after the walk and has an extensive display of photographs and artefacts.

There is no need to book, just meet [under the flagpole, Canon Garland Place, Toowong Cemetery](https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/community-and-safety/community-support/cemeteries/toowong-cemetery#location). There is plenty of parking available inside the cemetery.

Wear a hat, enclosed shoes, and bring a water bottle. 

There is no charge for the guided heritage walk but a gold coin donation is appreciated to allow us to continue [our work](about/index.md). Although we are a registered charity, donations are not tax deductable.
