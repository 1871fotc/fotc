# Archaeological Digs

Friends of Toowong Cemetery, in conjunction with the [University of Queensland Archaeology Department](https://social-science.uq.edu.au/undergraduate/archaeology), have been searching for buried headstones in the cemetery grounds since 2006.

The annual archaeology dig attempts to discover buried headstones from previously demolished graves. **[Why were graves demolished?](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-05-26/archaeology-dig-at-toowong-cemetery-a-chance-to-unearth-history/9800474)**
