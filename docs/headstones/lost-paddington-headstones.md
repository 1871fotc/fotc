# Lost Paddington Cemetery Headstones 

By 1914, headstones from the closed Paddington Cemetery that hadn't been relocated to other cemeteries were placed in a reserved area beside [Christ Church Milton](https://apps.des.qld.gov.au/heritage-register/detail/?id=600252). 

In the 1930's these headstones disappeared. Some of the headstones have been found buried in Toowong Cemetery.
