# Paddington Cemetery Remains and Headstones moved to Toowong Cemetery

The North Brisbane Burial Grounds were also known as 'Paddington Cemetery' or 'Milton Cemetery'. The burial grounds opened in 1844 and closed in 1875. 

The burial grounds had seven distinct denominational sections: Episcopalian (Anglican), Presbyterian, Roman Catholic, Jewish, Wesleyan Methodist, Congregational, and Baptist.

The mortuary chapel visible in the centre of the photograph was converted to a church in 1873, and was demolished when Christ Church (Milton) was constructed in 1874-76 â€” State Library of Queensland. Cropped.</small>*

By 1907 there were calls to turn the neglected burial grounds into a park and sports field. In 1911 the Queensland Government passed the *[Paddington Cemetery Act][Paddington Cemetery Act]* allowing them to move the bodies to another location. 

139 human remains and 105 memorials were moved from Paddington Cemetery to Toowong Cemetery.
