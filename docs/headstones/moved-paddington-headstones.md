# Moved Paddington Cemetery Headstones

The North Brisbane Burial Grounds were also known as 'Paddington Cemetery' or 'Milton Cemetery'. The burial grounds opened in 1844 and closed in 1875. 

The burial grounds had seven distinct denominational sections: Episcopalian (Anglican), Presbyterian, Roman Catholic, Jewish, Wesleyan Methodist, Congregational, and Baptist.

By 1907 there were calls to turn the neglected burial grounds into a park and sports field. In 1911 the Queensland Government passed the *[Paddington Cemetery Act][Paddington Cemetery Act]* allowing them to move the bodies to another location.
