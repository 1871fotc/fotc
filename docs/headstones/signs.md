#  Headstone Signs

Freed from the restrictions of parish churchyards, municipal cemeteries provided an outlet for expression of individualism which reached its zenith in the mid to late Victorian Era. The headstone reflected the deceased's cultural identity by its inscription, material, shape, symbol, or sign. These headstones are a reminder of how varied Brisbane society was from the late 1870s to the outbreak of World War One.

## Friendly Societies

Friendly societies were mutual aid organisations designed to help predominately working-class people insure themselves against destitution caused by death and illness. Many operated funeral clubs which for a few pence a month protected the contributors from the perceived disgrace of a pauper's grave.

Most organisations had rules, ranks and rites and developed a symbolic language which identified its members either by acronym or sign. Members were expected to turn out at funerals of the brethren or close relatives.

## Masonic Orders

Most cemetery visitors are familiar with the compass and square, the working tools of the Masonic orders, but these have variations which inform the knowledgable passer-by the rank held by the deceased in the organisation, such as the number of dots on the square. The "G" in the centre may be interpreted as "God" by speculative Masons, and as "Geometry" by operative Masons.

## Odd Fellows

The Odd Fellows were so named because they were originally drawn together from an odd variety of trades with insufficient numbers to form their own trade guilds. Their three-link chain stands for Friendship, Love and Truth. A variation is a monogram consisting of the letters F, C and B for friendship, charity and benevolence. Charity is also represented by a hand holding a heart and is most often associated with the Manchester Unity Independent Order of Odd Fellows (MUIOOF).

## Today

Some of these organisations have evolved to become financial services companies, such as: 

- The Independent Order of Odd Fellows became [IOOF](https://www.ioof.com.au/about-us/about-ioof), who in late 2021 decided to rebrand as Insignia Finance. 
- The Ancient Order of Foresters evolved into [Foresters Financial](https://forestersfinancial.com.au/about-us/our-history/).
- In 1993, the Australian Natives Association merged with Manchester Unity Independent Order of Odd Fellows to become [Australian Unity](https://www.australianunity.com.au/about-us/our-story).

You can find signs of Friendly Societies in the local area such as: 

- [Foresters Hall](https://apps.des.qld.gov.au/heritage-register/detail/?id=601662) 16 Latrobe Terrace, Paddington.
- [Baroona Hall](https://www.qld.gov.au/recreation/arts/heritage/experience/music-trail/baroona-hall) in Caxton St, Milton, built for the United Brothers Lodge of the Order of Odd Fellows.
- [Royal Antediluvian Order of Buffaloes Lodge Hall](https://heritage.brisbane.qld.gov.au/heritage-places/1827) in Woolloongabba.
