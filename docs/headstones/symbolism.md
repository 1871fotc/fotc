#  Headstone Symbolism

The Toowong Cemetery is a Brisbane icon and was once the city's main cemetery. Toowong Cemetery officially opened in July 1875, however burials took place from 1871 (most notably Queensland's second governor, Colonel Samual Blackall in 1871).

Toowong Cemetery opened during Queen Victoria's life (1819 - 1901) and you'll see the traditions and symbols from her reign throughout the cemetery.

In section 2 of the cemetery, at the intersection of Soldiers Parade and Garland Avenue, you'll find a display of symbols on headstones from the old Paddington Cemetery which closed in 1914.

Headstones within the Cemetery come in many shapes and sizes. Throughout the first half of the 19th Century headstones featuring bust of heads and shoulders were very popular. However by the 1880's angels, messengers of God and pillars had become fashionable. Most of these were placed on a three-tiered base, to represent faith, hope and charity. 

## The Cross

The cross comes in a variety of shapes. The Celtic cross (with its arms enclosed in a circle) was used mostly by those of Irish origin prior to the end of the 19th Century before they became a popular choice (regardless to national heritage). The unadorned cross was known as the Calvary cross, representing Christ's crucification. The Orthodox cross with three bars symbolises the cross Christ was crucified on, with the title board (top bar), the bar on which the Lord's hands were nailed (middle bar) and the footrest (bottom bar).

## Columns

Columns are indicative of heaven and their height implies the social status of the person buried. A broken column represents the break between life on earth and in heaven, and also a life cut short. Columns were also used to represent the loss of the head of family.

## Harp or Lyre

A harp or lyre symbolises hope, joy and music. It was the symbol of St. Cecila, the Patron Saint of Musicians, and is often associated with worship in heaven. This can be seen on the grave of Joseph Phillips (10-8-12).

## Clasped hands

Clasped hands symbolise the belief Victorians held that they would be reunited with their loved ones after death. If you look carefully at the cuffs of those shaking hands, you can often see that they are male and female. This can be seen are the grave of Herman Wuiski and his wife Emily (1-50A-10).

## Plants

Plants can represent a person's birthplace (such as thistles from Scotland) and also reflect religious meanings. See the grave of Michael McCormack and his wife Elizabeth (1-20-9) where ivy symbolises hope and mortality. Roses are another symbol that has multiple interpretations (including beauty, hope and love) and they are often associated with the Virgin Mary. The age of the deceased can also be revealed by the size of the flower or plant - a bud represents a child, and a full flower represents an adult.
