## Peter Jackson <small>(5‑28‑1)</small>

Peter was born on 3 July 1861 at Christiansted, St Croix in what was then the Danish West Indies. He was the son of Peter Jackson, a warehouseman and his wife, and grandson of a freed slave who had been owned by a planter with the surname of Jackson. 

Arriving in Sydney about 1880, he worked on the waterfront and in hotels before drifting into boxing in 1882 under the tuition of Larry Foley. In April 1888 he left for the United States and Britain, where he fought twenty-eight of the best boxers of England and America between 1888 and 1892, losing to none. He was one of the finest boxers never to fight for a world championship. Racial prejudice prevented him from being given the chance to win the world heavyweight crown. 

He died of tuberculosis at Roma in Queensland on 13 July 1901. £130 was raised by public subscription for a memorial over his grave. The unveiling ceremony performed by the Hon E B Forrest, MLA for North Brisbane took place on 12 May 1903 in the presence of most of those in the athletic and sporting world of southeast Queensland.
