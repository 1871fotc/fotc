# Story Index

**Read the stories of the people remembered at Toowong Cemetery**. The index below lists over 450 people mentioned in our **[self-guided walks](../walks/index.md)** and provides links to their stories. 

???+ warning "Work in progress"

    We're progressively creating individual pages for each person. Many people don't have links to their own page yet.


??? question "Volunteer - Contribute missing data"

    Do you know about any of the missing data in the Story Index? Did you spot an error? 
    Tell us the details by using the **☹︎** sad face button at the bottom of the page, or email us. 

    If you'd like to search for missing data, check out these **[Research Resources](research.md)**.
    
    If you would like your contribute a biography, please complete the **[Contribute a Story](https://forms.gle/4f743ggeHM3BiY2c8)** form.
    

??? directions "How to use the Index" 

    - Sort the table by clicking a column name.
    - The Last Name links to the person's story which may include information beyond what is shown in the self-guided walk. 
    - Also known as names are shown in *italics* in brackets.
    - Dates are formatted as yyyy-mm-dd (year, month, day) to help with sorting. Where a year, month or day is unknown, a placeholder value of "yyyy", "mm", or "dd" is used.
    - Location is in the Portion-Section-Grave format.
        - Where a Grave number is unknown, a placeholder value of "gg" is used. 
        - Learn more about **[finding graves at Toowong Cemetery](../cemetery/finding-graves.md)**.

Download the Story Index as a <a href="../assets/data/story-index.csv" download>Comma Separated Value file</a> (.csv) 


??? warning "Excel does not process dates correctly"

    If you open the .csv file using Microsoft Excel, be aware that it tries to be helpful and automatically adjust the date formats. This is not helpful, consider using another tool. It also doesn't handle characters like "ü".
    
    If you must use Excel, download the <a href="../assets/data/story-index-for-excel.csv" download>Comma Separated Value file for Excel</a> where we have:
    
      - put a space before the first number in the date to trick Excel into thinking it's text. 
      - replaced characters like "ü" with "u" *(we may have missed some)*
    
    You could also try turning off the Excel *background error checking* setting before loading the file. 
    
    We don't not promise we'll keep making special .csv files to cater for Excel's shortcomings.
