# 1919 Soldiers — Self-Guided Walk

!!! question "Volunteer opportunity"

    How embarrassing! We can't find all the electronic files for our walks. We're slowly re-keying the words from the Brochure pdf files. You can help by typing some and sending them to us. 
    
    Why have we published an incomplete page like this? So the people can be discovered in the search and their stories read in the Brochure.
