# Anchors Aweigh! 

**A Maritime Walk through Toowong Cemetery.**

The anchor is a symbol found on many Christian graves but it does not necessarily point to a maritime career. The source for the symbol is Hebrews 6:19, 

>Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast.

The allegorical figure, Hope, is often shown holding an anchor. Anchors may be shown with its rope crudely cut or a broken chain link to indicate the deceased has been removed from the land of the living, often prematurely.

## William Collin <small>(12-56-22)</small>

William, a master mariner, was born on 30 August 1834 at Great Wakering, Essex, the ninth of thirteen children of John Collin, a Suffolk farmer and his wife Sarah, née Viner. After only a basic education, fourteen-year-old William was working in the coastal coal trade and later on barges in the Thames. He left for Australia via Panama in 1854. Surviving a shipwreck 800 km off the Queensland coast, he eventually arrived in Sydney, via Calcutta! 

He married Eliza Baker of Newton on Christmas Day 1857 at Stephen’s, Camperdown. He worked on the Sydney waterfront until he could afford to purchase and refit a 25-ton vessel. He sailed this ship to Brisbane, where he settled with his family (which would eventually comprise thirteen children), and commenced a freight service to near-by coastal ports. William's other interest was the salvaging and breaking of ships. He was also engaged by the Queensland Government to lay submarine cables. 

William’s son and namesake was said to be the first Queensland-born sailor to receive his master’s certificate.

## Able Seaman Archibald Edward Bartsch <small>(10-44-20)</small>, Warrant Officer Henry Theeman <small>(10-41-21)</small>, Steward Eric Ross Harrison <small>(10-43-7)</small>

On the 4th of March 1942, the auxiliary minesweeper HMAS Tambar was fired on by the Examination Battery at Fort Cowan Cowan on Moreton Island. The military covered up the incident so as not to affect morale. The Tambar’s crew was dispersed throughout the RAN immediately after the men’s joint funeral two days later. The ship was temporarily paid off and the Captain given another command. The service was conducted by the Rev. H. H. Trigge of the Methodist Church and the Church of England’s Rev. F. R. C. Birch. Cannon and Cripps arranged the funeral.

There was a mix up in the identification code signal of the ship and the battery was ordered to fire across the bow of the unidentified vessel. The 6-inch shell struck the ship’s forecastle killing Able Seaman Archibald Bartsch, a member of the anchor party, instantly. The shell skidded across the deck into the Captain’s cabin killing Steward Eric Harrison. It then passed through the radio room critically injuring Warrant Officer Henry Theeman. Both of his legs were severed and his succumbed to his injuries soon after. Other crew received injuries to various degrees. London-born Theeman was aged 47. Bartsch, son of 3^rd^ Light horseman William Henry Bartsch, was an employee if the Australasian United Paint Company of Port Augusta, South Australia prior to his enlistment in the navy. He was aged 20. Western Australian-born Harrison was the son of William Ross and Rebecca Harrison. He was aged 33 from Melbourne.
