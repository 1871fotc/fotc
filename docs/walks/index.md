# Self-Guided Walks

The Friends of Toowong Cemetery have researched and published a large collection of themed self-guided walks. Choose a walk from the list below.

???+ example "Self-guided walk improvements" 

    We're progressively improving the self-guided walk format by converting them to a mobile-friendly format,  adding maps, walking instructions, and photos. Mobile-friendly walks are shown in bold.

    Some walks are A4 pdf files, designed to be printed and folded in half to make an A5 brochure.
