# Self-Guided Walks

The Friends of Toowong Cemetery have researched and published a large collection of themed self-guided walks. Choose a walk from the list below.

???+ example "Format improvements" 

    We're improving the self-guided walks  by converting them to a mobile-friendly format, adding maps, walking instructions, and photos. Mobile-friendly walks are shown in **bold**.

    Walks marked with an :octicons-pencil-24: are work in progress. 
    
    All walks include an A4 pdf file, designed to be printed and folded in half to make an A5 brochure.
