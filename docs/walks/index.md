# Self-Guided Walks

The Friends of Toowong Cemetery have researched and published a large collection of themed self-guided walks. 

Choose a walk from the list below.

???+ example "Walk formats" 

    - :fontawesome-solid-mobile-alt: Walks in bold use our new mobile-friendly web format 
    - :fontawesome-solid-book-open: Other walks are A4 pdf files, designed to be printed and folded in half to make an A5 brochure. They are in the process of being converted to the new format.
