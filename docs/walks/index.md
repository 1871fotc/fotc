# Self-Guided Walks

The Friends of Toowong Cemetery have researched and published a large collection of themed self-guided walks. Choose a walk from the list below.

!!! example "Format improvements" 

    We're progressively improving the self-guided walk format by converting them to a mobile-friendly format, adding maps, walking instructions, and photos. Mobile-friendly walks are shown in **bold**.

    Walks marked with an :octicons-pencil-24: are work in progress. 
    
    Non-converted walks are A4 pdf files, designed to be printed and folded in half to make an A5 brochure.
