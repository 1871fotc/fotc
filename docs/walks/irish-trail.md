# The Irish Heritage Trail 

==work in progress== 

[Notes](http://www.fotc.org.au/subset/Irish_Trail.pdf)

The original tours occurred in 1988 during the Bi‑Centennial Celebrations, under the auspices of the Genealogical Society of Queensland Irish Group with Chairman and Researcher David Larkin as tour guide. That original tour took in 31 monuments across a number of portions of the cemetery. Some of the more important figures on Mt Blackall are included on other Friends of Toowong Cemetery trails and so the present tour is confined to the Roman Catholic Portions 7 and 7a & 15 with 17 memorials to visit. The trail will take approximately one hour and 30 minutes. The original booklet has been revised and corrected early 2014 by Darcy Maddock.

The Friends of Toowong Cemetery Association would like to acknowledge the Queensland Government Community Benefit Fund for the grant to provide signage for this trail.

## ANNE DEVOY (7‑7‑34) 1817‑1908 

Born at Donadea near Hodgetown Co. Kildare, Devoy was the daughter of James and Honor Reilly. Her mother was the daughter of the Countess de Farnton, who escaped the guillotine in the French Revolution, and fled to Ireland to take up refuge with her friend, the Earl of Kildare at Castle Kilkea. Anne married Patrick Devoy and with the union came the “curse of the Devoys”. This had been placed on a Devoy of Huguenot stock who turned in a Catholic priest to Cromwell’s men. As he was taken away, the priest blessed all the Devoy women and cursed the men so that no male Devoy would live to see his son in manhood. The Devoys arrived in Queensland in 1864 on the Landsborough after selling their land in Ireland to the Ursuline nuns. They brought a young family with them; John (later managing director of XXXX), Marguerite and Annie. In the tradition of the curse Pat was killed the same year by a landslide while selecting land near Toowoomba.
