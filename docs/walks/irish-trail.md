# The Irish  

The original Irish tour occurred in 1988 during the Bi-Centennial Celebrations, under the auspices of the Genealogical Society of Queensland Irish Group with Chair man and Researcher David Larkin as tour guide. That tour took in 31 monuments across a number of portions of the cemetery. Some of the more important figures on Mt Blackall are included on other Friends of Toowong Cemetery walks and so this tour is confined to the Roman Catholic Portions 7, 7A and 15 with 17 memorials to visit. The walk takes approximately one hour and 30 minutes. The walk was revised and corrected early 2014 by Darcy Maddock.

## Anne Devoy <small>(7‑7‑34)</small>

1817 ‑[1908](https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/19550487?searchTerm=anne%20Devoy) 

Born at Donadea near Hodgetown Co. Kildare, Devoy was the daughter of James and Honor Reilly. Her mother was the daughter of the Countess de Farnton, who escaped the guillotine in the French Revolution, and fled to Ireland to take up refuge with her friend, the Earl of Kildare at Castle Kilkea. 

Anne married Patrick Devoy and with the union came the “curse of the Devoys”. This had been placed on a Devoy of Huguenot stock who turned in a Catholic priest to Cromwell’s men. As he was taken away, the priest blessed all the Devoy women and cursed the men so that no male Devoy would live to see his son in manhood. 

The Devoys arrived in Queensland in 1864 on the *Landsborough* after selling their land in Ireland to the Ursuline nuns. They brought a young family with them; John (later Managing Director of Castlemaine Perkins), Marguerite and Annie. In the tradition of the curse [Pat was killed the same year by a landslide](https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/123149288?searchTerm=Patrick%20Devoy) while selecting land near Toowoomba.

He took ill in 1932 and was brought down to Brisbane and sadly died at the very young age of 39 on 24 March 1932 leaving Zorah to bring up two young children. She took up millinery and many were the fashionable ladies at the Brisbane races wearing her creations.

The first Irish Heritage Trail was held in 1988 during the Bi‑Centennial Celebrations, under the auspices of the [Genealogical Society of Queensland Irish Group](https://www.gsq.org.au/what-gsq-offers/interest-groups/#english) with Chairman and Researcher David Larkin as tour guide. The original tour took in 31 monuments across a number of portions of the cemetery. Some of the more important figures on Mt Blackall are included on other Friends of Toowong Cemetery trails and so the present tour is confined to the Roman Catholic Portions 7, 7a, and 15 with 17 memorials to visit. The trail will take approximately one hour and 30 minutes. The original booklet has been revised and corrected early 2014 by Darcy Maddock.
