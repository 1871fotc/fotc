# Print Media Identities of Early Brisbane  

**… our liberty depends on freedom of the press, and that cannot be limited without being lost.** — Thomas Jefferson 1787


!!! question "Volunteer opportunity"

    How embarrassing! We can't find all the electronic files for our walks. We're slowly re-keying the words from the Brochure pdf files. You can help by typing some and sending them to us. 
    
    Why have we published an incomplete page like this? So the people can be discovered in the search and their stories read in the Brochure.
