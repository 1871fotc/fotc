## Charles Chesworth Burgess <small>(10‑76‑15)</small>

Charles was the son of Thomas Chesworth Burgess and Jane (née Gilbert). He was born on 9 May 1883 at the family property, *Foxley* at Christmas Creek near the Qld/NSW border. Charles enlisted in the AIF in June 1915, serving in Gallipoli, Egypt and France where he received a severe gunshot wound to his head in November 1916. After treatment in England, he returned to Australia in May 1917 and discharged three months later. 

Suffering from what was then termed 'shell shock', he was denied assistance in resettling and treatment. He retired to Glen Lamington in the Lamington National Park where he became known as the 'Hermit of Lamington'. Charles was an expert bushman and was brought into the limelight in February 1937 when he was involved in the rescue of the survivors of the Stinson plane disaster in the Macpherson Ranges. Just over two years later, on 11 April 1939, Charles died in the Brisbane General Hospital less than a month before his 56^th^ birthday.

The family may hay fallen on hard times as Reginald was educated at Chris's Hospital, London, at that time a school for orphans and children of indigent gentleman. His father may have died in 1869 while Reginald was head boy at the school.

After graduating from Oxford, Reginald was appointed headmaster of Brisbane Grammar School in 1876, the youngest headmaster in Australia at that time. He established cadet training and encouraged sport for his students. In July 1909 he was appointed Inspector-General of Schools for Queensland and Inspector of Grammar Schools in 1917.

He arrived in Brisbane in 1878 and was immediately appointed headmaster of the school at Roma. The following year he was promoted to the position of Schools Inspector. He covered thousands of miles on horseback, visiting schools all over Queensland. This life gave him the opportunity to further study natural sciences, which had formed his final University course and he published many scientific papers. He was awarded the degree of D.Sc. at the age of 63. 

In 1914 Dr Shirley became the first principal of the newly established Teachers' Training College in Brisbane, a position he held until retirement in 1919. He died at his residence in Bowen Hills on 5 April 1922 following a seizure.

In August 1918 he received a gunshot wound to his left cheek and was sent to hospital in England for treatment. By the time he left hospital, the war was over.

He then joined the City Electric Light Co as an electrical engineer. On 29 January 1925 he was erecting new wires at the Company's substation in Ipswich Road when he touched a live wire. Death was instantaneous.

He stayed on in France after the Armistice to assist with the repatriation of soldiers. 

On his return to Brisbane, he resumed his previous occupation of house painter. Family lore has it that he was involved in doing interior plaster work and painting in the Regent Theatre in Queen Street which opened in 1919. Albert died on 5 May 1950 at the age of 77.

## Robert (Bob) Toupein <small>(5‑96‑24)</small>

This was during a period of industrial and political unrest in the NT. One of the issues was lack of political representation in Federal Parliament for its residents. In 1917 Bob was elected to the Darwin Town Council and became Mayor of Darwin in 1919 but resigned in 1921. He was elected secretary of the North Australian Industrial Union and held that position until 1937 when he married and settled at Woody Point in Queensland.
