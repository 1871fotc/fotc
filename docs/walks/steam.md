!!! question "Volunteer opportunity"

    How embarrassing! We can't find all the electronic files for our walks. We're slowly re-keying the words from the Brochure pdf files. You can help by typing some and sending them to us. 
    
    Why have we published an incomplete page like this? So the people can be discovered in the search and their stories read in the Brochure.

## Captain Edmund Mellon <small>(9‑38‑4)</small>

Captain Mellon, an early immigrant to Moreton Bay, arrived in the colony in January 1849 on the sailing ship *Fortitude*. In the days when the river trade was the 'lifeline' between Brisbane and Ipswich, he became owner of the river steamers *Bremer* and *Settler*. The *Louisa*, the first iron steamboat ever constructed in the colony of Queensland was built by R.R. Smellie & Co to the order of Captain Mellor. After Mellor's death on 26 September 1872 at the age of 59, the *Louisa* was used on the Logan-Brisbane run.
