# Toowong Identities One 

**A Heritage Walk to commemorate the centenary of the Proclamation of the Town of Toowong in 1903.**

On 19 August 1903, the Shire of Toowong was proclaimed a town. At the time, the population numbered about 4700. The town grew rapidly, reaching 10,000 residents by 1922. Three years later the Toowong Town Council was absorbed into the Brisbane City Council.^1^ In August 2003, community celebrations were held to mark the centenary. 

This heritage walk was conceived as part of commemorative activities. It features only a small number of those former Toowong residents and associates who contributed in some way to Toowong’s social history.

## Sir Robert and Jessie Philp <small>(14‑23‑10)</small>

Jessie Philp, née Campbell was buried here in 1890. She was a 34‑year‑old politician’s wife and mother of seven. Her youngest child was just two weeks old when Jessie, weakened from recent childbirth, succumbed to the scarlet fever for which she was nursing two older children. Apart from her children, she was survived by her husband Robert (the Member for Townsville) and her parents and siblings. 

The next two burials here were of infant grandchildren of Robert and Jessie. In 1916, Jessie Ruth Henderson (known as Ruth) died from an unknown illness at the age of two. Twelve months later, an unnamed stillborn Henderson baby was also buried here. 

In 1922, when Robert Philp – by then Sir Robert – died, he was buried beside Jessie, although he had married for a second time in 1898. He had a long and distinguished parliamentary career, including twice being Premier of Queensland. He was also a well‑known businessman and co‑founder of Burns, Philp and Company. He lived at *Mallow* in Kensington Terrace, Toowong – now the site of the Brisbane Boys’ College boarding houses and dining room. 

The last burial in this grave took place in 1962 when Robert and Jessie’s eldest daughter Isabella Mary (known as May) died. She was 83 and had never married, though she had been engaged to Campbell Cowley from another Toowong family. From the age of 11, when her mother died, May looked after her younger brothers and sisters and later their children and grandchildren. She had a great interest in education, and was a benefactor to institutions like the University as well as providing books and cultural experiences for her extended family. Country nieces stayed with “Aunty May” to attend high school in Brisbane. She lived at *Mallow* until her death, and left the home and remaining grounds to BBC.

## Alfred Roberts <small>(13‑1‑2)</small>

Alfred was born in 1837 in Putney, London and arrived in Queensland in 1860. In 1872 he began a horse‑drawn omnibus line which operated between Eagle Street in the city and the present site of the Taringa Shopping Centre, where the Roberts’ home was. The fare to the city was one shilling or one shilling and sixpence return. Alfred would announce his arrival with a bugle call. The business was lost when the stables burned down about 1893. The Roberts family took up farming in Moggill.
