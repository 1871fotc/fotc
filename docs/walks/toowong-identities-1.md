# Toowong Identities Heritage Walk 1 

**A Heritage Walk to commemorate the centenary of the Proclamation of the Town of Toowong in 1903.**

On 19 August 1903, the Shire of Toowong was proclaimed a town. At the time, the population numbered about 4700. The town grew rapidly, reaching 10,000 residents by 1922. Three years later the Toowong Town Council was absorbed into the Brisbane City Council.^1^ In August 2003, community celebrations were held to mark the centenary. 

This heritage walk was conceived as part of commemorative activities. It features only a small number of those former Toowong residents and associates who contributed in some way to Toowong’s social history.
