He then energetically tried to replicate the movement in New Zealand. </p> <p>With Australia and New Zealand at war with the German Empire, Garland was recalled to Brisbane in 1915 and tasked with providing and coordinating chaplaincy and welfare services at Enoggera Army Base to thousands of fresh recruits. </p> <p>In the wake of climbing casualty lists and community grief, he urged legislators to establish a framework to enable the nation to publicly honour the service and sacrifice of Australian and New Zealand troops killed in the Gallipoli Peninsula landings of 25 April 1915. This movement culminated in a public meeting on 10 January 1916 at Brisbane's Exhibition Hall which voted to establish the Anzac Day Commemoration Committee of Queensland, with chaplain Lieutenant-Colonel Garland its secretary. </p> <p>Garland's contribution to Anzac Day tradition was to devise ecumenical or secular rituals for public commemoration of those who died in battle and and to comfort the bereaved. Because his format was non-denominational, everyone could participate, regardless of their faith tradition. The minute's silence provided a space for all Australian's and New Zealanders to demonstrate respect for The Fallen of the Great War. </p> <p>In 1916 Garland initiated a trust to receive money raised from the sale of silk, lavender-coloured badges embossed with gold leaf with the lion of St Mark and the motto \"Their Name Liveth for Evermore\". These became the first Anzac Day badges, initially earmarked to pay for the upkeep of soldiers' graves at home and abroad. The appeal eventually helped fund soldier respite hostels and memorials to be established. </p> <p>On the morning of Anzac Day 1920, the first since his return from war service, Garland visited \"Soldiers' Corner\" at Toowong Cemetery and found friends and families of the deceased paying their respects. Noting people of all religions were present, he asked all to observe a minutes' silence rather than offer up prayers during an impromptu commemoration service. </p> <p>Under the guidance of Garland the Anzac Day service at Toowong Cemetery grew in size and significance as did the badge-selling campaign which supported the Lady Mayoress's committee. The campaign's success helped fund the establishment of the \"Cross of Sacrifice\" and \"The Stone of Rememberance\" which were erected and unveiled in 1924 near the entrance to Toowong Cemetery immediately adjacent to Canon Garland Place. Anzac Day commemoration's in Brisbane where held here until the Anzac Memorial - Shrine of Rememberance - in Anzac Square, was completed in 1930.</p> <p>Garland officiated many funerals at Toowong Cemetery from 1910 onwards, including those for a significant number of returned servicemen of World War 1.

Following the opening of the Brisbane General Cemetery of Toowong in 1875, the seven sectarian cemeteries were gradually abandoned. By the end of the 19th century, the site had fallen into a state of disrepair. A decision was made in 1911 to have the Paddington Cemetery converted to public parklands. The memorials were subsequently removed and the opportunity was provided to relatives to relocate the remains and or memorials to other cemeteries including Toowong.

This movement culminated in a public meeting on 10 January 1916 at Brisbane's Exhibition Hall which voted to establish the Anzac Day Commemoration Committee of Queensland, with chaplain Lieutenant-Colonel Garland its secretary. </p> <p>Garland's contribution to Anzac Day tradition was to devise ecumenical or secular rituals for public commemoration of those who died in battle and and to comfort the bereaved. Because his format was non-denominational, everyone could participate, regardless of their faith tradition. The minute's silence provided a space for all Australian's and New Zealanders to demonstrate respect for The Fallen of the Great War. </p> <p>In 1916 Garland initiated a trust to receive money raised from the sale of silk, lavender-coloured badges embossed with gold leaf with the lion of St Mark and the motto \"Their Name Liveth for Evermore\". These became the first Anzac Day badges, initially earmarked to pay for the upkeep of soldiers' graves at home and abroad. The appeal eventually helped fund soldier respite hostels and memorials to be established. </p> <p>On the morning of Anzac Day 1920, the first since his return from war service, Garland visited \"Soldiers' Corner\" at Toowong Cemetery and found friends and families of the deceased paying their respects. Noting people of all religions were present, he asked all to observe a minutes' silence rather than offer up prayers during an impromptu commemoration service. </p> <p>Under the guidance of Garland the Anzac Day service at Toowong Cemetery grew in size and significance as did the badge-selling campaign which supported the Lady Mayoress's committee. The campaign's success helped fund the establishment of the \"Cross of Sacrifice\" and \"The Stone of Rememberance\" which were erected and unveiled in 1924 near the entrance to Toowong Cemetery immediately adjacent to Canon Garland Place.

Mobsby married Jenner's eldest daughter Mary Ellen on 10 September 1884 in Brisbane, and for some years taught decorative art at Brisbane Technical College. </p> <p>By October 1899 Mobsby had produced some thirty, one\u2011minute films during various 'still' photography excursions around Queensland. Among the earliest was the arrival of Governor Lamington for the opening of parliament on 18 May 1899. Most of the films made by Mobsby were shot in the spring of 1899 and illustrated wheat harvesting on the Darling Downs, sugar harvesting at Nambour and aspects of stock management. These were the first Australian industrial documentary films and are among the world's earliest films of the type. Mobsby also filmed the Queensland cabinet boarding the government paddle steamer Lucinda for a ministerial banquet.

Mobsby's reputation stemmed from his scenic photography and exhibition design. A fellow of both the Royal Geographical Society and the Royal Society of Artists, London, he regularly designed and organised Queensland's exhibits for the annual shows in southern capitals and at the Royal National Exhibition in Brisbane.

In 1866 he was awarded Mort travelling fellowship and undertook a 'grand tour' of Europe. </p> <p>Back in Queensland Griffith completed his articles in September 1867, immediately passed the Bar examinations. He first appeared in a Supreme Court action in 1867 and took silk in 1876. He married Julia Janet Thomson at East Maitland, on 5 July 1870. Griffith then entered politics winning the seat of East Moreton in 1872. Griffith became Liberal party leader in May 1879. Griffith was Premier from 10 November 1883 to 13 June 1888, and was appointed K.C.M.G. in 1886. After his government's defeat in 1888, Griffith spent twenty\u2011two months in Opposition. He was Premier again in August 1890.</p> <p>Griffith served as Queensland's chief justice from 13 March 1893 to 6 October 1903, during which he was appointed G.C.M.G. in 1895 and to the Privy Council in 1901.

On 18 July 1887 he was elected to the Legislative Assembly for Warwick and represented this electorate until 4 April 1896 when he stood aside to allow T. J. Byrnes to pursue the premiership via the seat. Morgan regained Warwick on 2 October 1898 at the by\u2011election after Byrnes's death and served the assembly as Queensland's first native\u2011born Speaker from May 1899 until September 1903. He resigned after a series of dramatic political events surrounding the defeat of the Philp government. Labor leader W. H.

After graduating from the University of Sydney in 1868, he went to London to study law and was called to the Bar on 6 June 1872. Cooper returned in 1874 and was admitted to the Queensland Bar. He became Crown Prosecutor in the northern district Supreme Court in 1878. After the death of Henry Beor, McIlwraith appointed Cooper his Attorney\u2011general. The appointment was ratified on 24 January 1881 when he won Beor's Bowen seat. Cooper held his office and seat until 5 January 1883 when he was appointed to the northern bench of the Supreme Court. He was elevated in October 1895 to senior puisne judge in Brisbane. </p> <p>When Griffith became Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, the Morgan ministry appointed Cooper Chief Justice of Queensland on 21 October 1903. Cooper was knighted in 1904. Although Cooper had temporarily deputised for the Governor in 1906, when the need to appoint a Lieutenant\u2011governor to succeed Sir Hugh Nelson arose in 1907, Lord Chelmsford could not ignore the objections of Premier William Kidston and he was passed over. Since Cooper had publicly censured the Ryan ministry in November 1915 and had publicly objected to its socialism, he was still regarded as unsatisfactory for the Lieutenant\u2011governorship; but with no alternative, Governor Sir Hamilton Goold\u2011Adams had to appoint him as Deputy for short periods in 1917\u201119. </p> <p>In November 1919, the Theodore ministry decided to appoint William Lennon as Lieutenant\u2011governor to which Cooper objected bitterly. Early in January he appealed for support from the governor\u2011general, and refused to admit the validity of a commission for Lennon drafted locally on telegraphic instructions from London; he deputised himself from 27 January to 3 February 1920 until Lennon's commission as Lieutenant\u2011governor arrived. That year while Lennon was on diplomatic sick leave in New South Wales, Cooper again became Lieutenant\u2011governor under his dormant commission. When asked, he refused to sign the executive council minute appointing Lennon president of the Legislative Council; he argued that the council was already over strength. On his return, Lennon was forced to appoint himself to the Council and to its presidency. Cooper died at his Chelmer home on 30 August 1923.</p> <p></p> <p>Hon.

Our population in Queensland is quite small, so its cemeteries number only ten and some have rarely been used. In Brisbane there is one at Toowong dating back from the 1870's and the other is at Mt Gravatt, which opened in 1966. Originally there was a small area in the old Lang Park (Paddington) Cemetery, but that was closed and the 3 known Jewish burials, and their monuments, were brought to Toowong in 1913. </p> <p>Jewish deceased are buried with their heads toward the East. This has a religious significance. Only one person is buried in each grave. Before the coffin is covered with earth, a small amount of soil of the Holy City of Jerusalem is sprinkled over it. Burial is conducted by a world\u2011wide, ancient organisation called the \"Chevra Kadisha\" (The Sacred Society). It has a variety of duties, all of a compassionate nature, e.g. care of orphans and widows, comfort of the dying, charity etc.</p> <p>Examples of vandalism will be seen in this cemetery. This is a world\u2011wide malady and difficult to prevent, as the damage is usually done late at night. It usually occurs during school vacations, indicating that the pupils, with no homework to do, are seeking cheap \"thrills\". On the occasions on which it occurs, the Chevra Kadisha promptly restores the damaged monuments. Some only need to be stood up and secured; others are broken when they fall. If they are thin marble slabs, they break easily and it is better to mount them on a sloping cement plinth so they cannot be toppled again. If the headstone is badly broken, it must be replaced.

In November 1848, aged twenty\u2011one she married Henry Callander, the eldest son of Randall W. Callander of Stirlingshire, Scotland. In 1852 Callander died aged 31 and Mary married William Howe and bore a daughter, Mary West Howe, in 1857. This second union ended with Howe\u2019s death, and it was as twice\u2011widowed in Sydney, that she met and married the distinguished bachelor, John Douglas, in 1861. Douglas was the nephew of the Marquis of Queensbury, a former pupil of Rugby School, and graduate of Durham University. He represented Camden, NSW at the time.</p> <p>Mary Douglas moved into the spotlight of Queensland public life when on June 22, 1865 the Hospital Committee noted that \u2018a letter from Mrs Douglas relating to nursing of children. She was the leader of the ladies\u2019 committee, a reflection of the confidence and respect in which she was held by the Hospital committee. An offer of Mary Douglas and the ladies\u2019 committee was to be the beginning of institutional care for orphaned, destitute and neglected children in Queensland. By the end of 1865 the child\u2011rescue institution at the Fever Hospital had become a busy centre for the increasing number of children unable to be cared for in the southeast of the colony and it was fast becoming a place of placement of any destitute child. The Fever Hospital was not strictly speaking an orphanage: parents who could persuade the orphanage committee of their need stood a good chance of having their application accepted and their child admitted.</p> <p>In 1869 a marked change occurred in management when John and Mary Douglas departed for London where John took up the position of Queensland Agent\u2011General. Around this time Governor Blackall made a public presentation of a silver salver to Mary Douglas and the Ladies\u2019 Committee, in the presence of a veritable \u2018Who\u2019s Who\u2019 of Brisbane society gathered at the Diamantina Orphanage. On her return Mary held a prominent and influential position in the child\u2011saving movement in Brisbane. However, in 1875 and 1876 during her endeavour to assert more direct managerial control over the orphan school \u2013 a model almost unheard of during this time.</p> <p>In November 1876, Mary Douglas was travelling in her pony\u2011drawn gig from her home in Bonnie Avenue, Clayfield to Brisbane when she was involved in an accident close to Newstead House gates, Breakfast Creek. Her pony shied at an approaching dray and her vehicle ran up a steep bank and overturned throwing Mary out. She died twelve hours later from severe injuries.1</p>","title":"Mary Douglas (9\u201134\u20115)"},{"location":"walks/notable-women/#florence-griffiths-buchanan-11334","text":"<p>A missionary and teacher, Florence was born on 16 September 1861 at Canterbury, Kent, daughter of Captain Neil Griffiths Buchanan of the 93rd Highlanders and his wife Elizabeth Jane, n\u00e9e Griffiths. Orphaned when young, Florence became the ward of a relation at Torquay, Devon. Despite her extremely delicate constitution and near\u2011blindness, she devoted herself as a young woman to both practical charity and prayer. After a physical breakdown in 1887, she accompanied her two brothers to Bundaberg, Queensland, where they purchased Oakwood, a substantial cane\u2011farm. Seriously injured in a riding accident in 1888, she was left permanently crippled. After teaching her Melanesian servants English and Bible stories, she later assumed responsibility for the non\u2011denominational South Seas Evangelical Mission (also known as the Queensland Kanaka Mission). In addition she served as Queensland secretary of both the International Scripture Union and the Young Women's Christian Association, and maintained at her own expense a hostel for English migrant girls.</p> <p>After Oakwood was destroyed in the 1893 floods, Florence Buchanan lived at Townsville and competently helped Bishop C. G. Barlow to administer his diocese. Two years later she worked among the multi\u2011racial communities of divers on Thursday Island. Forced to go to London for surgery, on her return she met Kashiwagi Taira, an educated storekeeper who introduced her into the usually closed Japanese community. Though only modestly successful in proselytizing them, she was revered and respected by everybody on the island for her generous hospitality, friendliness, humour and compassion. In 1906 Miss Buchanan was engaged first as a teacher and later as acting headmistress of the famed Singapore Chinese Girls' School; she also taught the orphans at St Mary's Home in Singapore. In 1907 she again underwent major surgery in London and, upon recovery, returned to Thursday Island and was ordained a deaconess in January 1908. In May she went to Moa Island and conducted the Anglican mission, taught school, and tried to inculcate skills necessary for economic self\u2011sufficiency.</p> <p>Florence Buchanan resigned her charge of the mission in 1911 because of deteriorating health, but she stayed on as a teacher. September she performed her last public function when she spoke on 'The mission field as a vocation for women' at the annual congress of the Church of England in Brisbane. She died of tuberculosis in St Helen's Methodist Hospital on 30 December.

She was possessed of unusual gifts, a fine presence, a wide, clear outlook, and eloquence that gave her a great advantage in pleading the cause in which she was interested. She came by force of her gifts prominently when any movement especially concerning the welfare of women and children was involved. She had a keen sense of humour, and her speeches were characterised by humour and brilliance. She was in demand whenever a new project was started for the betterment of the State, and although her invariable answer was, \u201cI\u2019m working to the pin of my collar,\u201d still there was always fitted in either another pin or an extra little stretch was given to the collar. </p> <p>Few women have left so clear a track successfully blazed in the history of Queensland. Mrs. Kingsbury was for years on the committee of the Sick Children\u2019s Hospital. Then when the claims of a woman\u2019s hospital were urged by Lady Lamington, Mrs. Kingsbury became one of the first members of the committee, relinquishing her guiding hand only when success had come to the institution. She became president of the Industrial Home for Women at Normanby Hill, and at a still later date the first president of the Queen Alexandra Home for orphans, neglected, or poor children, under the control of the Methodist Church. </p> <p>Still more presently, when war work was what mattered most in women\u2019s lives, Mrs. Kingsbury practically illustrated the doctrine of keeping the home fires burning by strengthening existing activities and at the same time, as president of the National Council of Women, she took an active part in \u201cSix o\u2019clock closing,\u201d the establishment of a bureau for the registration and classification of women for national work, the foundation of the British Australian League for the encouragement of Australian goods first, and those of the Empire next. She was elected president of the Women\u2019s Mutual Service club, and, with her committee, brightened with kindly sympathy the many weary hours of sorrow and anxiety of soldiers\u2019 relatives. Mrs. Kingsbury, for eight years, occupied the position of president of the National Council of Women, a federation of 44 societies, all interested in great national questions, especially in those affecting the welfare of women and children. On the occasion of the International Congress held in Rome in June, 1914, Mrs. Kingsbury represented the Queensland Council, and on her return familiarised the women of Brisbane with the representative women of other countries.3 Elizabeth was also an accomplished artist and wood carver.

He entered the service of the Indian navy in 1849, and remained an officer in it until its abolition in 1862 when he migrated to Queensland. He entered the public service in January 1866. At first in the Lands Department he was responsible for surveying the town sites of Charleville and Cunnamulla, and then became government land agent at Gladstone in 1867 and Gympie in 1868. In January 1869 he was appointed police magistrate at Somerset, on the northern tip of Cape York Peninsula, but resigned in August 1870 and left the service for five years. From 1875 to 1903 Chester served continually as a police magistrate. He was often appointed to remote and difficult communities in north Queensland. </p> <p>He returned to Somerset in September 1875 and on his advice the Queensland government transferred his headquarters in 1877 to a more central location at Thursday Island. There he kept order for eight years. He is probably best remembered for an incident in March 1883. Sir Thomas McIlwraith, put out by Britain's reluctance to annex a promising settlement in Papua, sent orders to Chester to go immediately to Port Moresby and take possession of the unoccupied eastern half of New Guinea. Sailing north in the Pearl, Chester planted the Union Jack at Port Moresby on 4 April 1883 and, as befitted an old naval officer, shelled a warlike party of Motu who were thought to threaten the security of the port. This act of occupation was later disowned by the British government. </p> <p>In April 1885 Chester was transferred to Cairns, where he promoted the formation of a Volunteer Defence Corps, one of several formed in Queensland through fear of the Russians, and served as lieutenant. But he was not popular with the local residents. In June 1887 the Griffith government was moved to transfer him to Cloncurry. Rather than accept demotion to such a remote post, Chester tendered his resignation, but in November the government appointed him police magistrate at the new Croydon goldfield. There he gave satisfaction and was transferred in 1891 to Cooktown and in 1898 to Clermont where he remained until transferred in 1902 to Gladstone.

Born in Ireland in 1847 as Catherine Mary Farrell, she immigrated to Australia with her brother in the 1860s. Kate Farrell is believed to have worked for the Jardine family on Cape York. Certainly she was at Somerset on 27 January 1868 when she married Marine John Smith at the Registrar\u2019s Office. Their marriage certificate shows John was 29, and a piano forte maker like his father; Kate was 21 and described herself as a servant. </p> <p>Kate Mary, a Catholic, and her Anglican husband John, arrived in Brisbane in 1874. Through their respective churches and his Freemasonry, they were able to make extensive social and business connections, despite living in poor circumstances themselves. John often applied his cabinet making and carpentry skills to produce coffins, subsequently becoming an undertaker. They lived in Peel Street, South Brisbane, and later at Manning Street, and bought the undertaking business of William Walsh in 1883. They operated for many years from George Street, just near the old Lands Department, and they competed for business with other undertakers such as Walter Barrett and the Hislops. Two years later John Smith was dealing with his solicitors about leasing land at the corner of Wickham and Gotha Streets, below the steep hill crowned by All Hallows. </p> <p>On 11 January 1886, the Smith family moved from South Brisbane to the Valley where they lived in the upper storey, above the business. Nearby were the very necessary stables, housing the hearses and the black horses that drew them. It was a many-faceted business, and they were on call day and night. But Kate Mary's husband was ill, suffering from consumption, and weakened by an attack on the Marines at Somerset in 1864 in which he had suffered two spear wounds, serious enough for him to have been sent to Sydney for some months. A few months later he died, at Wickham Street, aged 42, and was buried by a Church of England minister at Toowong on 20 May 1886. Kate Mary had run the business for some time already, assisted by her eldest son, John. She had learned how to embalm, a necessary skill to enable the transportation of bodies, but a rare one for a woman to master. This was especially remarkable as women of the time rarely attended funerals let alone work in the industry. She closely monitored all aspects of its operations and insisted on quality service.</p> <p>The company continued to develop as times changed, and was an early mover from horse drawn hearses to motor vehicles completing the process in 1932. Kate Mary was a generous supporter of the church and the Mater hospital. Strong and determined, she has been described as a feisty woman who did not suffer fools gladly. These qualities saw the company flourish, despite the hardships of World War One and the depression. Personal tragedy also continued to strike, by the time of her death in June 1932 aged 85, Kate Mary had buried four of her six children.</p>","title":"Kate Mary Smith (1-7-14)"},{"location":"walks/undertakers/#alfred-cannon-4-1-2122-and-joseph-cripps-4-28-6","text":"<p>Cannon and Cripps was formed in 1887 by Alfred Cannon and his brother-in-law Joseph Cripps.
