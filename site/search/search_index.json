Mobsby married Jenner's eldest daughter Mary Ellen on 10 September 1884 in Brisbane, and for some years taught decorative art at Brisbane Technical College. </p> <p>By October 1899 Mobsby had produced some thirty, one-minute films during various 'still' photography excursions around Queensland. Among the earliest was the arrival of Governor Lamington for the opening of parliament on 18 May 1899. Most of the films made by Mobsby were shot in the spring of 1899 and illustrated wheat harvesting on the Darling Downs, sugar harvesting at Nambour and aspects of stock management. These were the first Australian industrial documentary films and are among the world's earliest films of the type. Mobsby also filmed the Queensland cabinet boarding the government paddle steamer Lucinda for a ministerial banquet. Their last and most impressive films recorded Queensland troops bound for the South African War, the only known surviving footage of such departure shot in Brisbane between 28 and 31 October 1899. </p> <p>Mobsby became official artist and photographer for the Department of Agriculture in 1904 and remained until his retirement in 1930. He had scant direct involvement in subsequent Queensland government film production, preferring to commission others, such as the Salvation Army\u2019s former cameraman Sid Cook, to undertake the filmmaking. Mobsby's reputation stemmed from his scenic photography and exhibition design. A fellow of both the Royal Geographical Society and the Royal Society of Artists, London, he regularly designed and organized Queensland's exhibits for the annual shows in southern capitals and at the Royal National Exhibition in Brisbane.

The Hornibrook Group built more than 100 bridges, some of the better-known including the William Jolly, Story and New Victoria bridges in Brisbane, the Northbridge and Iron Cove Bridge in Sydney, and the Kings Avenue and Commonwealth Avenue bridges in Canberra.  </p> <p>Along with bridges, Manuel Hornibrook and his brothers, constructed drainage and sewerage works around Brisbane, Longreach, Roma and other towns in western Queensland. In fact, over a period of 40 years their companies built wool stores, wheat silos, wharves, sugar-sheds, tank farms, water mains, factories and electricity power-stations. Of course another highlight was the successful completion in the 1960s of the superstructure of the Sydney Opera House, including the sail-like roof.</p> <p>Personally, Manuel Hornibrook was known for his spirit, courage and determination and his genuine interest and concern for people, as evidenced by his work during the Great Depression. He was also president of the Hamilton Bowls club, a Rotarian and worked tirelessly for International House, at the University of Queensland.

In November 1848, aged twenty-one she married Henry Callander, the eldest son of Randall W. Callander of Stirlingshire, Scotland. In 1852 Callander died aged 31 and Mary married William Howe and bore a daughter, Mary West Howe, in 1857. This second union ended with Howe\u2019s death, and it was as twice-widowed in Sydney, that she met and married the distinguished bachelor, John Douglas, in 1861. Douglas was the nephew of the Marquis of Queensbury, a former pupil of Rugby School, and graduate of Durham University.

She was the leader of the ladies\u2019 committee, a reflection of the confidence and respect in which she was held by the Hospital committee. An offer of Mary Douglas and the ladies\u2019 committee was to be the beginning of institutional care for orphaned, destitute and neglected children in Queensland. By the end of 1865 the child-rescue institution at the Fever Hospital had become a busy centre for the increasing number of children unable to be cared for in the southeast of the colony and it was fast becoming a place of placement of any destitute child. The Fever Hospital was not strictly speaking an orphanage: parents who could persuade the orphanage committee of their need stood a good chance of having their application accepted and their child admitted.</p> <p>In 1869 a marked change occurred in management when John and Mary Douglas departed for London where John took up the position of Queensland Agent-General. Around this time Governor Blackall made a public presentation of a silver salver to Mary Douglas and the Ladies\u2019 Committee, in the presence of a veritable \u2018Who\u2019s Who\u2019 of Brisbane society gathered at the Diamantina Orphanage.

Orphaned when young, Florence became the ward of a relation at Torquay, Devon. Despite her extremely delicate constitution and near-blindness, she devoted herself as a young woman to both practical charity and prayer. After a physical breakdown in 1887, she accompanied her two brothers to Bundaberg, Queensland, where they purchased Oakwood, a substantial cane-farm. Seriously injured in a riding accident in 1888, she was left permanently crippled. After teaching her Melanesian servants English and Bible stories, she later assumed responsibility for the non-denominational South Seas Evangelical Mission (also known as the Queensland Kanaka Mission). In addition she served as Queensland secretary of both the International Scripture Union and the Young Women's Christian Association, and maintained at her own expense a hostel for English migrant girls.</p> <p>After Oakwood was destroyed in the 1893 floods, Florence Buchanan lived at Townsville and competently helped Bishop C. G. Barlow to administer his diocese. Two years later she worked among the multi-racial communities of divers on Thursday Island. Forced to go to London for surgery, on her return she met Kashiwagi Taira, an educated storekeeper who introduced her into the usually closed Japanese community. Though only modestly successful in proselytizing them, she was revered and respected by everybody on the island for her generous hospitality, friendliness, humour and compassion. In 1906 Miss Buchanan was engaged first as a teacher and later as acting headmistress of the famed Singapore Chinese Girls' School; she also taught the orphans at St Mary's Home in Singapore. In 1907 she again underwent major surgery in London and, upon recovery, returned to Thursday Island and was ordained a deaconess in January 1908.

Born in Ireland in 1847 as Catherine Mary Farrell, she immigrated to Australia with her brother in the 1860s. Kate Farrell is believed to have worked for the Jardine family on Cape York. Certainly she was at Somerset on 27 January 1868 when she married Marine John Smith at the Registrar\u2019s Office. Their marriage certificate shows John was 29, and a piano forte maker like his father; Kate was 21 and described herself as a servant. Kate Mary, a Catholic, and her Anglican husband John, arrived in Brisbane in 1874. Through their respective churches and his Freemasonry, they were able to make extensive social and business connections, despite living in poor circumstances themselves. John often applied his cabinet making and carpentry skills to produce coffins, subsequently becoming an undertaker. They lived in Peel Street, South Brisbane, and later at Manning Street, and bought the undertaking business of William Walsh in 1883. They operated for many years from George Street, just near the old Lands Department, and they competed for business with other undertakers such as Walter Barrett and the Hislops. Two years later John Smith was dealing with his solicitors about leasing land at the corner of Wickham and Gotha Streets, below the steep hill crowned by All Hallows. On 11 January 1886, the Smith family moved from South Brisbane to the Valley where they lived in the upper storey, above the business. Nearby were the very necessary stables, housing the hearses and the black horses that drew them. It was a many-faceted business, and they were on call day and night. But Kate Mary's husband was ill, suffering from consumption, and weakened by an attack on the Marines at Somerset in 1864 in which he had suffered two spear wounds, serious enough for him to have been sent to Sydney for some months. A few months later he died, at Wickham Street, aged 42, and was buried by a Church of England minister at Toowong on 20 May 1886. Kate Mary had run the business for some time already, assisted by her eldest son, John. She had learned how to embalm, a necessary skill to enable the transportation of bodies, but a rare one for a woman to master. This was especially remarkable as women of the time rarely attended funerals let alone work in the industry. She closely monitored all aspects of its operations and insisted on quality service.</p> <p>The company continued to develop as times changed, and was an early mover from horse drawn hearses to motor vehicles completing the process in 1932. Kate Mary was a generous supporter of the church and the Mater hospital. Strong and determined, she has been described as a feisty woman who did not suffer fools gladly. These qualities saw the company flourish, despite the hardships of World War One and the depression. Personal tragedy also continued to strike, by the time of her death in June 1932 aged 85, Kate Mary had buried four of her six children.</p>","title":"Kate Mary Smith (1-7-14)"},{"location":"walks/undertakers-underground/#alfred-cannon-4-1-2122-and-joseph-cripps-4-28-6","text":"<p>Cannon and Cripps was formed in 1887 by Alfred Cannon and his brother-in-law Joseph Cripps.
