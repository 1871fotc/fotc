Public cemeteries were first established in the 19th Century as churchyard burial grounds became overcrowded.</p> <p>Land set aside in 1865 as a cemetery reserve was affirmed as Brisbane General Cemetery on 10 October 1870 when the appointed trustees met for the first time after Governor Blackall\u2019s wish to be buried there. Toowong Cemetery\u2019s first burial occurred on 3 January 1871 and until its official opening in July 1875, only six people were buried there. People were reluctant to use the remote cemetery through lack of public transport, meaning they faced an arduous and expensive seven kilometre journey by horse-drawn carriages along dirt roads. Today, the 44 hectare site is the final resting place for more than 119,000 people. Funerals in the Victorian era were a grand public affair, with coffins carried to the cemetery by horse-drawn hearses, followed by large gatherings of family and friends all dressed in sombre black. Finally, the body was laid to rest under the most elaborate headstone the family could afford.</p> <p>Victorian\u2019s love of ancient symbolism is reflected in the designs of their monuments. Throughout Toowong Cemetery you will notice symbols of hope and immortality, such as ivy; clasped hands suggesting farewell or reunion; and urns and obelisks inspired by a revived interest in Egyptian, Greek and Roman symbolism. Monuments also reflect prevailing architectural styles and building materials. Just as the Victorian attention to detail and ornamentation has given way to function and simplicity in architecture, modern headstones have become more subdued, losing much of the extravagance and elegance of 19th Century monuments.  </p> <p>More information on the symbolism used in Victorian era cemeteries like Toowong Cemetery can be found at the Cemetery Office and at Portion Two. </p>","title":"Welcome to Toowong Cemetery"},{"location":"walks/bcc-walk-1/#start-the-walk","text":"<p>Before starting, you may like to download the Toowong Cemetery map.  </p> <p>Begin the heritage trail at the pavilion and head south-east along Federation Avenue1 to the impressive fenced monument of Lieutenant-Colonel James Forsyth Thallon.</p>","title":"Start the walk"},{"location":"walks/bcc-walk-1/#lieutenant-colonel-james-forsyth-thallon-1847-1911","text":"<p>Lieutenant-Colonel James Forsyth Thallon was the Queensland Commissioner for Railways from 1902-1911.

From this time, between 1913-1942, until his resignation, he led a great career in Australian public life breaking all state parliamentary records at the time. He held office for a longer period than any other Labor Premier in Australia and was the only Queensland political leader to win the people's confidence at four successive elections, leading the Queensland Labor Party for 13 years. His record term at the head of the Queensland Government was one day short of 10 years and three months, from 17 June 1932 to 16 September 1942.  </p> <p>After his time as Premier he took over the chairmanship of the Central Sugar Cane Prices Board, and later also chairmanship of the Sugar Board. Despite strained relations with the University of Queensland over funding and development, he was also granted an honorary Doctorate of Laws in 1935 and later appointed Chancellor in 1944, a position he retained until his death in 1953.

In an effort to create employment and provide support for families during the depression, the Hornibrook Highway was constructed during the 1930s and included what was Australia's longest bridge at the time of its construction. The Hornibrook Group built more than 100 bridges, some of the better-known including the William Jolly, Story and New Victoria bridges in Brisbane, the Northbridge and Iron Cove Bridge in Sydney, and the Kings Avenue and Commonwealth Avenue bridges in Canberra.  </p> <p>Along with bridges, Manuel Hornibrook and his brothers, constructed drainage and sewerage works around Brisbane, Longreach, Roma and other towns in western Queensland. In fact, over a period of 40 years their companies built wool stores, wheat silos, wharves, sugar-sheds, tank farms, water mains, factories and electricity power-stations. Of course another highlight was the successful completion in the 1960s of the superstructure of the Sydney Opera House, including the sail-like roof.</p> <p>Personally, Manuel Hornibrook was known for his spirit, courage and determination and his genuine interest and concern for people, as evidenced by his work during the Great Depression.

Their marriage certificate shows John was 29, and a piano forte maker like his father; Kate was 21 and described herself as a servant. Kate Mary, a Catholic, and her Anglican husband John, arrived in Brisbane in 1874. Through their respective churches and his Freemasonry, they were able to make extensive social and business connections, despite living in poor circumstances themselves. John often applied his cabinet making and carpentry skills to produce coffins, subsequently becoming an undertaker. They lived in Peel Street, South Brisbane, and later at Manning Street, and bought the undertaking business of William Walsh in 1883. They operated for many years from George Street, just near the old Lands Department, and they competed for business with other undertakers such as Walter Barrett and the Hislops. Two years later John Smith was dealing with his solicitors about leasing land at the corner of Wickham and Gotha Streets, below the steep hill crowned by All Hallows. On 11 January 1886, the Smith family moved from South Brisbane to the Valley where they lived in the upper storey, above the business. Nearby were the very necessary stables, housing the hearses and the black horses that drew them. It was a many-faceted business, and they were on call day and night. But Kate Mary's husband was ill, suffering from consumption, and weakened by an attack on the Marines at Somerset in 1864 in which he had suffered two spear wounds, serious enough for him to have been sent to Sydney for some months. A few months later he died, at Wickham Street, aged 42, and was buried by a Church of England minister at Toowong on 20 May 1886. Kate Mary had run the business for some time already, assisted by her eldest son, John. She had learned how to embalm, a necessary skill to enable the transportation of bodies, but a rare one for a woman to master.
