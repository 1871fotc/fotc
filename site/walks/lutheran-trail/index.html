<h2 id="carl-franz-alexander-schirmeister-and-caroline-friedericke-alwine-schirmeister-13256">Carl Franz Alexander Schirmeister and Caroline Friedericke Alwine Schirmeister <small>(13‑25‑6)</small></h2>

<p>A talented musician, he was educated at Halle University and became a Pastor of the Prussian Union Church. He trained in the Gossner Mission Society in Berlin and in 1842 he, and others, were sent to the Chatham Islands and arrived there in 1843. When the mission came to an end, he worked as a tutor for the Hunt family on Pitt Island for 2 years. In poor health he went to New Zealand, then Sydney, arriving in Brisbane after the mission at German Station had closed. </p>
<p>The first Lutheran service was held in the city in May 1857 where he secured Crown Grants of Land for the church. He was the first registered Lutheran minister in Queensland after separation. Fluent in English, he traveled far and wide to minister to people and conduct services. He became the first President of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Queensland. </p>
<p>His wife, Alwine, née Gehricke, (3 June 1818 - 30 Nov 1894) trained at the Elizabeth Deaconesses’ Home and Hospital in Berlin.

<p>In 1895 Ernst wanted a German day school at St Andreas, where English‑speaking children were also admitted, which would be under the direction of a teacher who was fluent in both languages. He met his wife at St. Andreas and they married in 1886 producing six children. </p>
<p>Anti‑German feeling during WWI forced the business, which had been carried on by Mrs Eschenhagen, to be sold in November 1915. </p>
<p>One of their sons, Oskar Wilhelm Eschenhagen (1889 - 1969), who changed his name to Oscar Edwards during WWI, operated a successful transport business in Sydney but is better remembered, with his wife, as being art collectors. In the early 1950s they met Picasso and Matisse. He was an accomplished artist himself and gave works to galleries, which included the Queensland Art Gallery.</p>
<h2 id="johann-christian-and-sophia-esther-heussler-136411">Johann Christian and Sophia Esther Heussler <small>(13‑64‑11)</small></h2>
<p>John Heussler was born on 15 June 1820 at Bockenheim, Germany (near Frankfurt‑am‑Main) and arrived in Queensland in 1854. His background was as a wine merchant in London and Holland. He married Sophia Esther, daughter of John and Christian Westgarth of Edinburgh. She came to Queensland from Victoria with her mother, also buried here, and sister, shortly after their arrival in Australia. John and Sophia Heussler married in Brisbane on 10 March 1859. John Christian died on 26 Oct 1907 and his widow died on 5 June 1914. While “religion was not to play a big role in his life”, he was buried according to Lutheran rites from Nazareth Church, Hawthorne Street, Woolloongabba. </p>
<p>He played a large role in immigration, particularly encouraging an estimated two thousand German Lutherans to come to Queensland. He built Fernberg, the current home of the Governor of Queensland but lost it to creditors in 1879. He was appointed a member of the Legislative Council in 1866, holding the position until his death. He became Honorary Consul for the German Empire and also for the Netherlands. In 1896 he opened the new school of the Nazareth Lutheran Church and presented a gift of 400 marks from the German Kaiser.</p>
