On Thursday, 13 November 1884, Alfred was riding his Penny Farthing bicycle along North Quay when he fell and injured the middle finger of his right hand. He was admitted to Brisbane Hospital with a Tetanus infection on Wednesday, 19 November 1884. Doctors agreed the finger needed to be amputated, Dr. Thomson performing the operation. [Alfred did not recover and died in hospital](https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/184996065) on the night of Thursday, 20 November 1884. [His death was reported in *The Queenslander*](https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/23976600?searchTerm=%22Joseph%20Duggan%22) on Saturday, 29 November 1884, noting the cause of death as, *"a wound of finger, tetanus, asphyxia".*

Other sources use the name, *"Alfred Joseph Duggan"*, so it is unclear why the headstone is inscribed, *"Joseph Alfred Duggan"*. The headstone also states Alfred was, *"In the 20^th^ year of his age"* however *[The Queenslander](https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/23976600?searchTerm=%22Joseph%20Duggan%22)* reported he was 19 years old. Perhaps he had his birthday after the accident.

Alfred died [intestate](https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/3438912?searchTerm=%22Alfred%20Duggan%22) and *"all the land, goods, chattels, credits, and effects"* of [under £35](https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/19797033?searchTerm=%22Alfred%20Duggan%22) were given to his spinster sister, Miss Frances Lilian Duggan. Ironically, the two newspaper reports also mixed his sister's first and middle names.
