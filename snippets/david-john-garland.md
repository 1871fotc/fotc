## David John Garland <small>(1-50a-9)</small>

Born in Dublin, Ireland, in 1864, David John Garland was a Church of England missionary and chaplin to Western Australia's Boer Wae contingent before coming to Queensland.

Between 1902 and 1939 he and Archdeacon of North Queensland and rector at St Paul's Church, Charters Towers, then rector at Holy Trinity Church, Wooloongabba, and finally rector at St Barnabas' Church, Red Hill.

His crusading efforts on behalf of the "Bible-in-State Schools League" in the west led him to be invited to organise a similar campaign in Queensland. He then energetically tried to replicate the movement in New Zealand. 

With Australia and New Zealand at war with the German Empire, Garlan was recalled to Brisbane in 1915 and tasked with provinding and coordinating chaolaincy and welfare services at Enoggera Army Base to thousands of fresh recruits. 

In the wake of climbing casualty lists and community grief, he urged legislators to establish a framework to enable the nation to publicly honour the service and sacrifice of Australian and New Zealand troops killed in the Gallipoli Peninsula landings of 25 April 1915. This movement culminated in a public meeting on 10 January 1916 at Brisbane's Exhibition Hall which voted to establish the Anzac Day Commemoration Committee of Queensland, with chaplin Lieutenant-Colonel Garland its secretary.
