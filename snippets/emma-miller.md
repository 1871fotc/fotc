[Miller](https://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/miller-emma-7583) was born Emma Holmes in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, in June 1839. Her first husband died in 1870 leaving her with four small children to support. Emma was a gentlemen’s shirtmaker and she began to take in piecework, working twelve hours per day, six days per week. With her second husband, Miller arrived in Brisbane in March 1879. He died just over a year after their arrival. Widowed again, Emma was forced to make her living by needlework. Miller was in the vanguard of the formation of women’s unions, the women’s suffrage movement, and the Labor Party. She actively supported strikers during the 1880s, and worked to alleviate the plight of the unemployed. She campaigned tirelessly for freedom from conscription. Through these activities, she was known and admired throughout the country, and given the affectionate title ‘Mother of the Australian Labor Party’.
