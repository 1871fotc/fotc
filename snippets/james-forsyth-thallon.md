The son of a Scottish engineer, Robert Thallon and his wife, Jean née Forsayth, James Forsyth Thallon was the Queensland Commissioner for Railways from 1902 to 1911. He was born in Markinch, in Fifeshire, Scotland in 1847 and entered the railways in Edinburgh as a 15-year-old apprentice. He came to Queensland in 1882 to take up a management position in the Southern and Western Railways.
