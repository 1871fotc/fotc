??? warning "No Spoilers"  

    These notes were originally provided with one of our **[guided tours](../guided-tours.md)**. A story was told by one of our volunteers at each grave. We don't publish our speaking notes so we don't spoil repeated guided tours for others.
    
???+ warning "Guided tour handout"

    These brief notes were originally provided as a handout to participants on with the particular guided tours. Our volunteer presenter told a more comprehensive story at the graveside of how each of the walk subjects related to the theme of that specific tour. The story did not necessarily contain all of the biographical information published here on the subject nor all the information contained in the Sources.
