Ann Hill (1850‑1871) was the second person buried in Toowong Cemetery, after Governor Blackall. Walter Hill, her father, was appointed first Superintendent of the Brisbane Botanic Gardens in 1855. As a tribute to Walter Hill, the [Walter Hill fountain](https://apps.des.qld.gov.au/heritage-register/detail/?id=600067#) was erected in the City Botanic Gardens in 1867. This explanatory plaque was unveiled by the Lord Mayor Clem Jones in 1972.
