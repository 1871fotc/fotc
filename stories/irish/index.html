<!-- https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/19550487?searchTerm=anne%20Devoy -->

<p>Born 1817 at Donadea near Hodgetown Co. Kildare, Devoy was the daughter of James and Honor Reilly. Her mother was the daughter of the Countess de Farnton, who escaped the guillotine in the French Revolution, and fled to Ireland to take up refuge with her friend, the Earl of Kildare at Castle Kilkea. </p>
<p>Anne married Patrick Devoy and with the union came the “<em>curse of the Devoys</em>”. This had been placed on a Devoy of Huguenot stock who turned in a Catholic priest to Cromwell’s men. As he was taken away, the priest blessed all the Devoy women and cursed the men so that no male Devoy would live to see his son in manhood. </p>
<p>The Devoys arrived in Queensland in 1864 on the <em>Landsborough</em> after selling their land in Ireland to the Ursuline nuns. They brought a young family with them; John (later Managing Director of Castlemaine Perkins), Marguerite and Annie. In the tradition of the curse <a href="https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/123149288?searchTerm=Patrick%20Devoy">Pat was killed the same year by a landslide</a> while selecting land near Toowoomba. Anne died in 1908.</p>

<p>The large white monument to this family and the story of how Mayne gained his wealth is the subject of a book by Rosamond Siemon, <em>The Mayne Inheritance</em>. Mayne was born in 1824 at Cookstown, Tyrone, the son of Isaac Mayne and Rose Mullin. He arrived in Brisbane in 1849 after marrying in Sydney, Mary McIntosh from Ennis, Co. Clare. </p>
<p>Mayne gained his wealth by the reputed murder of a cedar cutter and established his butcher business in Queen St where the present Brisbane Arcade stands. He was an Alderman of the Brisbane City Council 1853 to 1865, the year he died of a heart attack. His rumoured death‑bed confession extracted a promise from his children that they would not continue the family line. The family’s finances eventually benefited many public institutions especially The University of Queensland.</p>

The ship left London 29<sup>th</sup> April 1890 and the trip was interrupted at 6.30AM on the 16<sup>th</sup> May when she hit the Daedulus Reef in the Red Sea. All passengers were able to climb down onto the rocks of the reef where they all stood in waist deep water until some were moved to the rocks surrounding the lighthouse. According to the <em>London Illustrated News</em>, May 20<sup>th</sup>, The passengers lost everything except the wet clothes they were standing in when the ship sank four hours later. No lives were lost. </p>

Babinda, Roma St, Helidon and mainly Bundaberg When royalty visited Bundaberg the only place big enough to host the function was the refreshment rooms. He was well respected. He took ill in 1932 and was brought down to Brisbane and sadly died at the very young age of 39 on 24 March 1932 leaving Zorah to bring up two young children.
